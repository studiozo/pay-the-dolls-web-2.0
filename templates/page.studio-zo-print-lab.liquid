  <h2>Welcome to the Print Lab</h2>
  <p>I wanted to build a storefront to sell my art, merch, and other ideas. I already had the Pay The Dolls Shopify and URL — and I didn't want another login, another account to keep up with, or to do all the same work twice.</p>
  <p>So instead, I converted Pay The Dolls into its next evolution and where I hope to take the direction and art.</p>
  <p><strong>Welcome to Pay The Dolls.</strong></p>
  <p>The platform where DØLLs launch products, build storefronts, and generate revenue. Multi-vendor. Multi-category. Infinitely scalable.</p>
  
  <h2>The Print Lab</h2>
  <p>I've launched my first Print Lab — because we're printing money.</p>
  <p>DØLLs can set up a storefront and join a community to buy and print. They own their revenue (minus a small transaction fee to keep the lights on #fuckuconed).</p>
  
  <h2>Where the Money Goes</h2>
  <p><strong>Revenue from Pay The Dolls merch → Verse Capital</strong></p>
  <p>A little VC pot to throw money at other trans artists, creators, projects, and who knows what else.</p>
  <p>Is it officially a capital fund? No — not yet.</p>
  <p>For now, it's getting earmarked in my bank account.</p>
  <p>But if you'd like to invest $1 million into the pot, we are accepting equity raises.</p>
  <p><strong>DM me.</strong></p>
  
  <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Art prints</strong> from my studio</li>
    <li><strong>Merch designs</strong> (apparel, accessories, stickers)</li>
    <li><strong>Limited drops</strong> and experimental work</li>
    <li><strong>Other DØLLs' storefronts</strong> (coming soon)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>The Vision</h2>
  <p>Right now, this is my storefront.</p>
  <p>Soon, it's a marketplace where other trans and queer creators can launch their own stores.</p>
  <p>Everyone keeps their revenue (minus transaction fees). The ecosystem funds itself. Capital circulates. We build wealth in our community.</p>
  <p>Not charity. Not grants. Not waiting for permission.</p>
  <p><strong>Just: make your thing, sell your thing, fund the next thing.</strong></p>
  
  <h2>This is Version 0.1</h2>
  <p>It's rough. It's early. It's real.</p>
  <p>I'm figuring this out as I go.</p>
  <p>If you're a creator who wants a storefront, hit me up. If you want to support, buy something. If you want to invest in Verse Capital, I'm serious — DM me.</p>
  
  <h2>A Note from ZØ</h2>
  <p>I built this because I was tired of waiting.</p>
  <p>Tired of platforms taking 30-50%. Tired of grants that take months. Tired of asking permission to build.</p>
  <p>So I'm building the infrastructure myself.</p>
  <p>It's not perfect. It's not polished. But it's ours.</p>
  <p>And if it works, we're changing the game.</p>
  <p>Welcome to the Print Lab.</p>
  <p>Let's print some money.</p>
