TSX → Liquid: ZO Instructions

Purpose
- Explain how React/TSX components in `components/` map to Shopify Liquid templates and sections.
- Provide a reproducible workflow for converting, testing, and maintaining pages (Mission / Verse, etc.).

Short summary of the approach
1) Keep the canonical UI code in `components/` (React/TSX) for design previews and local dev.
2) When shipping to the Shopify theme, convert the component to a `section` (or template) in Liquid using the same HTML structure and utility classes.
3) Move any required CSS to theme assets or utility CSS already used by the theme (prefer reusing Tailwind-like classes or existing styles in `assets/theme.css`).
4) Connect dynamic fields (editable text, images) to Section settings or to metafields so content is editable from Shopify admin.
5) For interactive features (JS-driven), implement a small vanilla JS module in `assets/` or use an app proxy. Avoid shipping complex React into Liquid unless you have an app that handles SSR / embed.

Detailed Steps: TSX -> Liquid
1. Identify the component to convert
   - Example: `components/Mission.tsx` is the canonical mission view.
   - For Verse content, create or use `components/Verse.tsx` as the canonical source, then convert to a Liquid section named `sections/verse.liquid` and a template `templates/page.verse.liquid` (if needed).

2. Create a Section
   - Make `sections/mission.liquid` and `sections/verse.liquid` (or `section--mission.liquid` depending on naming conventions).
   - Copy the HTML structure from the JSX into the section, replacing JSX props and React-only constructs:
     - Convert `className` → `class`
     - Replace onClick navigation with anchor links `href` pointing to the relevant page (e.g., `<a href="/collections">Shop</a>`).
     - If the component uses props for content, expose them as section `settings` so the admin can edit them.

3. Associate a template
   - Add `templates/page.mission.liquid` and `templates/page.verse.liquid` with:
     {% raw %}{% section 'mission' %}{% endraw %}
   - This makes the page accessible at `/pages/mission` and editable in the theme customizer.

4. Move styles and scripts
   - If the TSX component used utility classes (Tailwind-like), ensure the theme has corresponding styles.
   - For component-specific JS (sliders, modals), add a small `assets/mission.js` that attaches behavior to DOM elements and include it in the section with a script tag.

5. Data & dynamic content
   - For content the store team needs to edit (headings, CTA text, images), add section `settings` and use `{{ section.settings.my_setting }}` in Liquid.
   - For product/collection data, use Shopify objects: `collections`, `product`, `collection.products`, or metafields (for ID-linked content).

6. Testing & QA
   - Test locally: update `sections/header.liquid` to ensure the menu points to the correct pages: Shop (/collections), Brands (/pages/brands), Verse (/pages/verse-capital), Mission (/pages/mission), Submit (/pages/submit), About (/pages/about), Contact (/pages/contact).
   - Test in Theme Preview after uploading the section/template.

Nav / Menu guidance
- The requested site menu (top nav) should be:
  1. Shop → `/collections` (shows collections/all)
  2. Brands → `/pages/brands` (Brands page / BrandsIndex)
  3. Verse → `/pages/verse-capital` (Verse landing or /pages/verse)
  4. Mission → `/pages/mission` (Mission page, use `sections/mission.liquid`)
  5. Submit → `/pages/submit` (submit form)
  6. About → `/pages/about`
  7. Contact → `/pages/contact`

Where should "Verse Capital" pull from?
- Authoritative source: create `components/Verse.tsx` (React) in `components/` to be the canonical UI source.
- When converting, create `sections/verse.liquid` and `templates/page.verse.liquid` that mirror the component markup and expose editable fields as `settings` or pull data from metafields.
- If Verse includes a submission form (applications), wire that to Shopify contact forms (`form` action) or an app-proxied backend for server-side handling.

Best practices
- Keep presentational markup and styles in `components/` for dev previews and prototyping.
- Keep production Liquid sections the single source for what appears on Shopify (so content is editable in admin).
- Use section `settings` rather than hard-coded content for shop-editable text.
- For interactive behavior, prefer small, dependency-free JS to keep theme lightweight.

Example: Mission.tsx → sections/mission.liquid
- TSX snippet:
  <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">PAY THE DØLLS™</h1>
  <p className="mb-6">To pay the dolls.</p>
- Liquid section:
  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">PAY THE DØLLS™</h1>
  <p class="mb-6">{{ section.settings.mission_text }}</p>

Notes for ZO
- Keep `components/` as the design/dev source. When a component is ready to ship to the live site, convert it to a Liquid section and connect editable bits to section settings.
- For new pages (Mission / Verse), add templates under `templates/` and include the corresponding section.
- Keep a short changelog in `assets/zo_instructions/zo_instructions_tsx-to-liquid` when a conversion is done (date, component name, template/section name, any JS added).

Questions? If you want, I can:
- Convert `components/Mission.tsx` → `sections/mission.liquid` and `templates/page.mission.liquid` now as an example.
- Create `components/Verse.tsx` and the corresponding Liquid `sections/verse.liquid` and `templates/page.verse.liquid`.
